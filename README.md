update 18/12/2020:

The brute force with optimized approch was implemented, now the program might early exit if the formula has already been 
proved or disproved.

update 21/12/2020:
Finish the first version of PNS search, tested correctly.

update 23/12/2020:
Some memory optimization was done, at most 4 formulas are stored in memory. Used strategy design pattern on the CnfExpression class,
get ready for implementing DPLL algorithm and unit propagation.

update 24/12/2020:
Implement a very brute force version of the unit-propagation algorithm, tested correctly and the performance of the solver is improved
significantly.
